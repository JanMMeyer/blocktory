## Why is there a aabb-3d-scr folder in this repo?
**That folder is the downloaded source from fenomas abb-3d fork. It is here because the aabb-3d node module that npm downloads form fenomas repo is not a proper package, as it is missing the dist folder. The aabb-3d-src folder contains all souces and dist folder that is generated by npm run build.**

#### IMPORTANT: The dist in the aabb-3d-src folder need to be copied into the aabb-3d node module, after npm install!
